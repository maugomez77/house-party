## Akka
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaAkka#Configuration
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaAkka#Configuration

# other streaming HTTP responses.

        # default.
        parallelism-max = 24

        # Setting this to LIFO changes the fork-join-executor
        # to use a stack discipline for task scheduling. This usually

        # latency and risking task starvation (which should be rare).
        task-peeking-mode = LIFO

  # "akka.log-config-on-start" is extraordinarly useful because it log the complete

  # putting at the very top.
  #
  # Put the following in your conf/logback.xml file:

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
# db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
# db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
# db.default.user=sa
# db.default.password=""

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# This is the main configuration file for the application.
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ConfigFile
# ~~~~~
# Play uses HOCON as its configuration file format.  HOCON has a number
# of advantages over other config formats, but there are two things that
# can be used when modifying settings.
#
# You can include other configuration files in this main application.conf file:
#include "extra-config.conf"
#
# You can declare variables and substitute for them:
#mykey = ${some.value}
#
# And if an environment variable exists when there is no other subsitution, then
# HOCON will fall back to substituting environment variable:
#mykey = ${JAVA_HOME}


## Modules

## IDE
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/IDE

## WS (HTTP Client)
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaWS#Configuring-WS
# ~~~~~
# The HTTP client primarily used for REST APIs.  The default client can be

# with customized settings. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += ws // or javaWs if using java

## Cache
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaCache
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaCache
# ~~~~~
# Play comes with an integrated cache API that can reduce the operational
# overhead of repeated requests. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += cache
#
play.cache {
  # If you want to bind several caches, you can bind the individually
  #bindCaches = ["db-cache", "user-cache", "session-cache"]
}

## Evolutions
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# Evolutions allows database scripts to be automatically run on startup in dev mode
# for database migrations. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += evolutions
#
play.evolutions {
  # You can disable evolutions for a specific datasource if necessary
  #db.default.enabled = false
}

## Database Connection Pool
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/SettingsJDBC
# ~~~~~
# Play doesn't require a JDBC database to run, but you can easily enable one.
#
# libraryDependencies += jdbc
#
play.db {
  # The combination of these two settings results in "db.default" as the
  # default JDBC pool:
  #config = "db"
  #default = "default"

  # Play uses HikariCP as the default connection pool.  You can override
  # settings by changing the prototype:
  prototype {
    # Sets a fixed JDBC connection pool size of 50
    #hikaricp.minimumIdle = 50
    #hikaricp.maximumPoolSize = 50
  }

## JDBC Datasource
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaDatabase
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaDatabase
# ~~~~~
# Once JDBC datasource is set up, you can work with several different
# database options:
#
# Slick (Scala preferred option): https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/PlaySlick
# JPA (Java preferred option): https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaJPA
# EBean: https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaEbean
# Anorm: https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaAnorm
